My long-term goal is to conduct multidisciplinary and collaborative research on the healthy development of hippocampal subfields in order to understand the role of this structure in supporting cognitive gains observed across development.

Throughout my work, I have been captivated by the individual differences in children’s development at multiple levels—from neurobiology to cognition—and the environmental factors that explain these differences. Thus, my program of research examines normative development and the factors that modify healthy brain and cognitive development. 

Specifically, my research focuses on the development of episodic memory and its neural correlates in children between the ages of 4- to 8-years. To answer questions about how the brain and memory co-develop I utilize a combination of behavioral measures and neuroimaging (both MRI and EEG), with a focus onlongitudinal analyses (mixed-effect models, latent growth models). I am also interested in the neural computational process supporting memory (e.g., pattern separation) in relation to specific subfields of the hippocampus.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working with both [Dr. Noa Ofen](http://ofenlab.wayne.edu){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Ana Daugherty](https://s.wayne.edu/healthyaging/){:target="\_blank"} at Wayne State Univeristy.

I completed my doctoral training in Cognitive and Neural Systems program within the Psychology Department at the University of Maryland under the advisement of [Dr. Tracy Riggins](http://ncdl.umd.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
