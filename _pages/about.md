Throughout my work, I have been captivated by the individual differences in children’s development at multiple levels—from neurobiology to cognition—and the environmental factors that explain these differences. Thus, my program of research examines normative development and the factors that modify healthy brain and cognitive development. 

Specifically, my research focuses on the development of episodic memory and its neural correlates in children between the ages of 4- to 8-years. I utilize a combination of behavioral measures and neuroimaging (both MRI and EEG), with a focus on longitudinal analyses (mixed-effect models, latent growth models).

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Dr. Noa Ofen](http://ofenlab.wayne.edu){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Ana Daugherty](https://s.wayne.edu/healthyaging/){:target="\_blank"} at Wayne State University. I completed my doctoral training under the advisement of [Dr. Tracy Riggins](http://ncdl.umd.edu){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Maryland. 

You can find my full [CV](https://kcanada.github.io/assets/pdf/Canada_Kelsey_CV_21.pdf){:target="\_blank"} here.
