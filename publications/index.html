      <p>Previous studies have found that children show rapid and significant improvements in their ability to remember individual items and the contextual details that surround these items (i.e., episodic memory) during early childhood. Encoding processes have been suggested to contribute to the development of episodic memory; however, few studies have investigated encoding processes. The goal of the current study was to examine age- and performance related effects on encoding in children between 4 and 8 years of age using event-related potentials (ERPs). Results revealed effects of both age and performance on encoding, as indexed by the ERPs response. However, the nature of these effects differed between subsequent recognition and subsequent recollection, as well as for the two ERP components (i.e., Nc and LSW) examined. These findings are important as they contribute empirical evidence that encoding processes show developmental change across early childhood. In addition, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for performance differences in future studies examining developmental changes in episodic memory.</p>

      <p>The hippocampus is a structure that is critical for memory. Previous studies have shown that age-related differences in specialization along the longitudinal axis of this structure (i.e., subregions) and within its internal circuitry (i.e., subfields) relate to age-related improvements in memory in school-age children and adults. However, the influence of age on hippocampal development and its relations with memory ability earlier in life remains under-investigated. This study examined effects of age and sex on hippocampal subregion (i.e., head, body, tail) and subfield (i.e., subiculum, CA1, CA2-4/DG) volumes, and their relations with memory, using a large sample of 4- to 8-year-old children. Results examining hippocampal subregions suggest influences of both age and sex on the hippocampal head during early childhood. Results examining subfields within hippocampal head suggest these age effects may arise from CA1, whereas sex differences may arise from subiculum and CA2-4/DG. Memory ability was not associated with hippocampal subregion volume but was associated with subfield volume. Specifically, within the hippocampal head, relations between memory and CA1 were moderated by age; in younger children bigger was better, whereas in older children smaller was superior. Within the hippocampal body, smaller CA1 and larger CA2-4/DG contributed to better memory performance across all ages. Together, these results shed light on hippocampal development during early childhood and support claims that the prolonged developmental trajectory of the hippocampus contributes to memory development early in life.</p>

      <p>The ability to keep similar experiences separate in memory is critical for forming unique and lasting memories, as many events share overlapping features (e.g., birthday parties, holidays). Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental profile and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory specificity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subfields. Specifically, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.</p>

      <p>Across early childhood, children’s ability to remember individual items and the details that accompany these items (i.e., episodic memory) improves greatly. Given that these behavioral improvements coincide with increases in age, effects of age and performance are often confounded. This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate age- and performance-related differences in the neural processes underlying the development of memory for details during early childhood. Using a source memory paradigm, ERP components related to episodic memory, the negative component (Nc), and late slow wave (LSW) were examined in 4- to 8-year-old children. Analyses focused on trials for which children correctly remembered the source related to an item versus trials where the item was remembered but the source was forgotten. Results revealed LSW, but not Nc, differed as a function of age and performance. Specifically, LSW effects were similar across source correct and source incorrect trials in all high-performing children and in low-performing older children; however, LSW effects differed across conditions in low-performing younger children. Results show developmental differences in retrieval processes across early childhood and highlight the importance of considering age and performance when examining electrophysiological correlates of episodic memory during development.</p>

      <p>Early childhood is characterized by vast changes in behaviors supported by the hippocampus and an increased susceptibility of the hippocampus to environmental influences. Thus, it is an important time to investigate the development of the hippocampus. Existing research suggests subregions of the hippocampus (i.e., head, body, tail) have dissociable functions and that the relations between subregions and cognitive abilities vary across development. However, longitudinal research examining age-related changes in subregions in humans, particularly during early childhood (i.e., 4–6 years), is limited. Using a large sample of 184 healthy 4- to 8-year-old children, the present study is the first to characterize developmental changes in hippocampal subregion volume from early- to mid-childhood. Results reveal differential developmental trajectories in hippocampal head, body, and tail during this period. Specifically, head volume showed a quadratic pattern of change, and both body and tail showed linear increases, resulting in a pattern of cubic change for total hippocampal volume. Further, main effects of sex on hippocampal volume (males &gt; females) and hemispheric differences in developmental trajectories were observed. These findings provide an improved understanding of the development of the hippocampus and have important implications for research investigating a range of cognitive abilities and behaviors.</p>

      <p>Existing studies examining the development of temporal order memory show that although young children perform above chance on some tasks assessing temporal order memory, there are significant age-related differences across childhood. Yet, the trajectory of children’s ability to retrieve temporal order remains unclear as existing conclusions are drawn from cross-sectional studies. The present study utilized an accelerated longitudinal design in order to characterize the developmental trajectory of temporal order memory in a sample of 200 healthy 4- to 8-year-old children. Specifically, two tasks commonly used in the literature were tested longitudinally: a primacy judgment task and an ordering task. Results revealed that, even after controlling for differences in IQ, linearly increasing trajectories characterized age-related change in performance for both tasks; however, change appeared greater for the temporal ordering task. Further, performance on the two tasks was positively related, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms. These findings provide a more thorough understanding of temporal order memory in early to middle childhood by characterizing the developmental trajectories of two commonly used tasks and have important implications for our understanding of children’s developing memory more broadly.</p>

      <p>Memories for events that happen early in life are fragile—they are forgotten more quickly than expected based on typical adult rates of forgetting. Although numerous factors contribute to this phenomenon, data show that one major source of change is the protracted development of neural structures related to memory. Recent empirical studies in early childhood reveal that the development of specific subdivisions of the hippocampus (i.e., the dentate gyrus) is related directly to variations in memory. Yet, the hippocampus is only one region within a larger network supporting memory. Data from young children have also shown that activation of cortical regions during memory tasks and the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and cortex relate to memory during this period. Taken together, these results suggest that protracted neural development of the hippocampus, cortex, and connections between these regions contribute to the fragility of memories early in life and may ultimately contribute to childhood amnesia.</p>

      <p>The hippocampus is a brain structure known to be important for memory. However, studies examining relations between hippocampal volume and memory across development yield mixed results. This may be due in part to the fact that volume is a coarser measure of hippocampal composition. Studies have begun to examine measures of diffusion, which capture characteristics of the microstructure of the hippocampus, and thus may provide additional information about the integrity of the underlying neural circuits. The present study applied this approach to a developmental period characterized by dramatic changes in both hippocampal microstructure and memory behavior – early childhood. Specifically, measures of hippocampal microstructural integrity were related to age and source memory performance in 93 children aged 4–8  years. Results revealed significant negative associations between hippocampal mean diffusivity and both age and memory, even after controlling for differences in hippocampal volume. These results suggest that hippocampal diffusion may provide additional, independent information about hippocampal integrity compared to volume, particularly during early childhood when important developmental changes have been proposed.</p>

      <p>The hippocampus has been suggested to show protracted postnatal developmental growth across childhood. Most previous studies during this developmental period have been cross-sectional in nature and have focused on agerelated differences in either hippocampal subregions or subfields, but not both, potentially missing localized changes. This study capitalized on a latent structural equation modeling approach to examine the longitudinal development of hippocampal subfields (cornu ammonis (CA) 2-4/dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, subiculum) in both the head and the body of the hippocampus, separately, in 165 typically developing 4- to 8-year-old children. Our findings document differential development of subfields within hippocampal head and body. Specifically, within hippocampal head, CA1 volume increased between 4− 5 years and within hippocampal body, CA2-4/DG and subiculum volume increased between 5− 6 years. Additionally, changes in CA1 volume in the head and changes in subiculum in the body between 4− 5 years related to improvements in memory between 4− 5 years. These findings demonstrate the protracted development of subfields in vivo during early- to mid-childhood, illustrate the importance of considering subfields separately in the head and body of the hippocampus, document cooccurring development of brain and behavior, and highlight the strength of longitudinal data and latent modeling when examining brain development.</p>
